    "# Logging in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is a handy tool in a programmer’s toolbox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logs provide developers with an ability to monitor in detail the progress and errors and flow of information in an application. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an error occurs, logs can provide more insights than a stack trace by telling you what the state of the program was before it arrived at the line of code where the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "By logging useful data from the right places, you can find and fix errors easily but also use the data to analyze the performance of the application to plan for scaling. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The logging funnel\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging encourages you to log a lot of data, and then gives multiple mechanisms for filtering out that data. It’s similar to a funnel: lots of data goes in, but most of it gets filtered out before leaving the system as formatted logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "That leads to simple application code that stays the same (just log everything!) from environment to environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Filters can then be configured via settings and config files to match the environment: if you’re debugging locally you may want to filter nothing out and create log records of everything, but on production, you only want to know about errors, in which case you can add more filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical background: Log4J\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging in python is heavily influenced by a logging paradigm popularized by the __log4j__ java library.\n",

    "The most commonly used classes defined in the __`logging`__ module are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Logger`: This is the class whose objects will be used in the application code directly to call the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LogRecord`: Loggers automatically create LogRecord objects that have all the information related to the event being logged: the name of the logger, the function, the line number, the message, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Handler`: Handlers send the LogRecord to the required output destination, like the console or a file. Handler is a base for subclasses like StreamHandler, FileHandler, SMTPHandler, HTTPHandler, and more. These subclasses send the logging outputs to corresponding destinations, like sys.stdout or a disk file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Formatter`: This is where you specify the format of the output by specifying a string format that lists out the attributes that the output should contain.\n",
